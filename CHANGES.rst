1.0.3 (2013-01-13)
------------------

- There was a problem with the charset regular expression, it expected one
  space, and only one, between mimetype and charset. So a valid values like
  "text/html;charset=utf-8" didn't match and default_encoding was returned.
  We fixed it by allowing any number of spaces (including zero).
